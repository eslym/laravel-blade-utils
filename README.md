composer require eslym/laravel-blade-utils ^1.0
````

## Configuration
### Laravel
Let package discovery to do its job.

...
$app->register(Eslym\BladeUtils\Providers\BladeUtilServiceProvider::class);
...
````

### Features
#### Fix for ```@json``` directive
This fix made ```@json``` directive supports more complex syntax.

```@json([$val1, $val2, $val3, $val4])``` will be compiled to ```<?php echo json_encode([$val1, $val2, $val3, $val4], 15, 512); ?>``` instead of ```<?php echo json_encode([$val1, $val2, $val3); ?>``` by original blade directive.

#### Better ```@each``` directive
```@each``` directive will now include with variables in current scope.

#### ```@js``` and ```@css``` directives
Syntax:

````blade
@js($uri, [$sri], [$crossorigin])
@css($uri, [$sri], [$crossorigin])
````
